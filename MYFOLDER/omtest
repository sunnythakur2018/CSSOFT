Why is DevOps is Needed?
•	Before DevOps, the development and operation team worked in 
complete isolation.
•	Testing and Deployment were isolated activities done after 
design-build. Hence they consumed more time than actual build cycles.
•	Without using DevOps, team members are spending a large amount 
of their time in testing, deploying, and designing instead of building 
the project.
•	Manual code deployment leads to human errors in production
•	Coding & operation teams have their separate timelines and are 
not in synch causing further delays.
